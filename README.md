# Primes

The main goal for this is to familiarize myself with C# again. I think to play around with numbers and program some stuff from number theory is probably the best way to get into the basics of a programming language. And actually I love prime numbers... these are in my opinion the atoms in mathematiks and to me most fascinating.
